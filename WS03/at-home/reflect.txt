Workshop 3 Reflection:

1. How to use templates. 
The keyword template can be used to declare or define a function or class, defines a member function, a member class, a member enumeration, or static data member of a class template or a class nested within a class template, defines a member template of a class or class template, declares an alias. A template body accepts externally specified types through the parameters in the template header.  Parameters serve as placeholders throughout the template body for the arguments specified in the template call. In this workshop, I use class templates to declare four class: class Pair, class PairSummable, class Set and class SetSummable.

2. Specialized template classes and functions.
A template specialization defines an exception to a template definition. In this workshop, I use template specialization to define the sum function.

3. A polymorphic object can have different types throughout its lifetime. In this workshop, I only add the word "virtual" to one function in the base class.

4. I learned use braces initialization.


Quiz 3 Reflection:
Question 3:
My mistake answer: Why cloning of a polymorphic object at different stages of execution is not straight
forward and requires extra information? All of the above
The correct answer: Why cloning of a polymorphic object at different stages of execution is not straight
forward and requires extra information? In order to allocate the correct amount of memory for the copy.

Question 10:
My mistake answer:  In Code 2.0, Line 19 will print null pointer on third type-cast?NO.
The correct answer:  In Code 2.0, Line 19 will print null pointer on third type-cast?Yes.

Question 11:
My mistake answer: In Code 2.0, Line 21 will print null pointer on fourth type-cast?Yes.
The correct answer: In Code 2.0, Line 21 will print null pointer on fourth type-cast?NO.
