1. an explanation of the syntax used to pass a lambda expression to a function that will use that expression and the syntax used to receive the lambda expression in the function that uses it
 First, to pass a lambda expression to a function, I stored it in a auto variable named "letter". It saved the lambda expression I made. And I can use function with () and parameter inside.
 Second, To receive the lambda expression, I used templated function. template type can receive any type. Therefore, it also can receive function expression and use it.
