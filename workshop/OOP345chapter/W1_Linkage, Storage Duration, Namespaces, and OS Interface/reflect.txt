1. identify the linkage, if any, between your modules
CString.cpp line 17: static int no = 10;
It is to count how many data I am printing. Since it's local variable but using for another dobject, I thought it would be better to use it as internal linkage. I do not need to use external linkage because it is only being used in CString module only.

2. identify the storage duration of the variable that keeps track of the record number in the insertion operator for your CString class.
It is CString.cpp line 17: static int no.
The duration of the variable is while the execution. It will be arrived til the program is actually finished even if other object is destroyed.
