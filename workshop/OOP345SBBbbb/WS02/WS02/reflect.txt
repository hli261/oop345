In this workshop I learned how to implemented how to properly implement copy constructors, move constructors as well as their operators while using pointers as private members of a class.
I learned how std::strings worked with the heap and stack memory.
I also learned how to utilize some classes such as <sstream>, <algorithm>, and much more.
