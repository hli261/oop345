- The reason for using the vector container rather than any other available in the STL.

The vector container is the closest relative to an array - since it stores contiguous data without the need of tracking what's before/after the index. However, vectors have the ability to handle its own destruction once the object goes out of scope. 
- Why there is no need to deallocate the dynamically allocated memory in your own code.
Vectors have the ability to deallocate when the object goes out of scope.

- How the range-based for simplifies coding in this case.
Instead of accessing via index (i.e product[i]), we don't need to worry about the index since the current element (the pointer to the element within the container itself) of the container is accessed via reference (&) in a range based for loop.
