# C++ Overview/Building Blocks

- `Encapsulation` means that a group of related properties, methods, and other members are treated as a single unit or object.
- `Inheritance` describes the ability to create new classes based on an existing class.
- `Polymorphism` means that you can have multiple classes that can be used interchangeably, even though each class implements the same properties or methods in different ways.
